# Personal Portfolio Speedrun
We will be racing to get a personal portfolio webapp (basically a resume) built b4 the FDOC (Jan 10th). While it does not need to be 100% polished, have something in a working place before this deadline.

## Requirements
* Create a new repository based on this tempalte
* Use some sort of web framework (Flask, Django, Express + Handlebars, React, MEVN, etc...)
* Have some way to show any current and future projects you build
* Upload to the cloud so it can be seen by others
* Turn this readme document into a list of features/selling pitch towards your final design

## Tips
* Show off your strengths! Try to exemplify certain skills you think make you shine above the competition
* Be creative and unique; don't make reddit...
* Look at other portfolios. Don't copy them to a tee, but use them as inspiration
